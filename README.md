# YT_CLIP

This project is only for downloading video from YouTube and can trim the video. I use ffmpeg to handle video and node-file-downloader to show progress. 
Due to limited resource in my VPS if you trim video, script download only to the end of the trimmed length and can only handle 10 minutes videos.
